## ✨ Features

- Handles Yanhekt anti-hotlinking protection based on reverse engineering, enabling video playback and downloads.
- Optimized for campus networks: watch Yanhekt videos without buffering; smooth playback at 10x speed for recorded videos; download speeds up to 110MB/s<sup>1</sup>.
- Run slide extraction simultaneously with video playback; no need to download videos; a 145-minute course is processed in 15 minutes at 10x speed.
- Prevents system sleep during slide extraction tasks, allowing for long overnight runs.

> [!TIP]
> To speed up processing, you can use `AutoSlides` to download course videos and then use `AutoSlides Extractor` for processing.

- AI filtering based on multimodal large language models (vLLM) to remove non-fullscreen slide images and other distracting content.

> [!TIP]
> vLLM processing is extremely effective, with a tested accuracy of 99.9%, far superior to machine learning model solutions.
>
> Recommended models: `gpt-4.1`, `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct`, `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Instruct`, and `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct`. Tests show that even the lightweight model `qwen3-vl-2b-instruct` running locally via LM Studio achieves good recognition results.

- Merge the extracted slides into a PDF; compress images to reduce file size.

<sup>1</sup> When connected to the campus network via wired connection, peak download speeds can reach 120MB/s; speeds are slower via Wi-Fi.

<sup>2</sup> The web version uses simplified image processing algorithms suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

<sup>3</sup> The web version provides note-taking and exporting to Word and Markdown documents.

<sup>4</sup> **Using both tools together is faster**: Using `AutoSlides` to download a 95-minute course screen recording takes about 10 seconds on the campus network; using `AutoSlides Extractor` to process that video (I-frame interval 2s) takes about 10 seconds on an M4 Mac mini.

<sup>5</sup> Can only handle login with account/password via BIT Unified Identity Authentication; login during "non-routine hours" may require secondary verification; pre-verify at [sso.bit.edu.cn](https://sso.bit.edu.cn).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download

- Go to the [release page](https://github.com/bit-admin/Yanhekt-AutoSlides/releases) 👈 to download the installer for your platform (macOS users download `DMG` file; Windows users download `EXE` file; Linux users download `AppImage` or `deb` file).

### 2. Install
   - **macOS**: Open the `.dmg` installer and drag the app icon to the `Applications` folder.
      - Double-click the `install.command` file inside the installer to run the installation script. You will receive an "Apple cannot verify security" prompt; close this prompt first.
      - Open `System Settings > Privacy & Security`, as shown, click `Open Anyway`.
      - Enter your Mac password in the terminal (note that the password will not be displayed while typing).

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/dmg.png" alt="AutoSlides DMG Installer" width="100%">
</p>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - macOS marks downloaded applications as "quarantined" to ensure safety.
> - AutoSlides does not use an Apple Developer Certificate.
> - Besides double-clicking `install.command`, you can also manually run the following command in the terminal to remove the quarantine attribute and allow the application to run normally:
>   ```shell
>   sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/AutoSlides.app
>   ```

   - **Windows**: Run the `.exe` installer and follow the setup wizard.

   - **Linux**:
     - **AppImage**: Download the `.AppImage` file, add execute permission and run:
       ```bash
       chmod +x AutoSlides-*.AppImage
       ./AutoSlides-*.AppImage
       ```
     - **Deb Package** (Debian/Ubuntu):
       ```bash
       sudo apt install ./AutoSlides-*.deb
       ```

> [!NOTE]
> **Linux Users Note**: Video download functionality requires FFmpeg. The app bundles an FFmpeg binary, but it may not be compatible with some Linux distributions (especially ARM64 architecture). If download functionality has issues, install system FFmpeg:
> ```bash
> # Debian/Ubuntu
> sudo apt install ffmpeg
>
> # Fedora
> sudo dnf install ffmpeg
>
> # Arch Linux
> sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
> ```
> The app will automatically detect and use system-installed FFmpeg.

### 3. Check for Updates

- Click `Menu Bar > AutoSlides > Check for Updates...` (on Windows/Linux `Menu Bar > Help > Check for Updates...`) to see if a new version is released.
- Manually download and install the latest version from the [release page](https://github.com/bit-admin/Yanhekt-AutoSlides/releases).

> [!NOTE]
> - Due to lack of backward compatibility, it is recommended to always completely remove the old version before installing a new version of `AutoSlides`.
> - If you encounter problems after installing a new version, try using the `Advanced Settings > General > Reset All Data` function; alternatively, you can remove the support files for the old version:
>   - **macOS**: Run the following command in the terminal or manually find and remove `~/Library/Application\ Support/AutoSlides`:
>     ```bash
>     rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/AutoSlides
>     ```
>   - **Windows**: Find and remove `C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Roaming\AutoSlides` or `C:\ProgramData\AutoSlides`
>   - **Linux**: Find and remove `~/.config/AutoSlides`:
>     ```bash
>     rm -rf ~/.config/AutoSlides
>     ```

#### C. Core Parameter Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> - SSIM Threshold: Higher Global Structure Similarity threshold means stricter matching.
>   - Recommended to adjust only when necessary. Even 0.001 change can significantly affect performance.
>   - Use [Online Test](https://learn.ruc.edu.kg/test) 👈 or open `test-image-comparison.html` in browser to test and calibrate SSIM algorithm.

1. `SSIM Threshold` contains five preset modes: `Adaptive/Strict(0.999)/Standard(0.9987)/Relaxed(0.998)/Custom(0.990-0.9999)`.
  - `Adaptive` mode is specially optimized for different teaching buildings; some buildings have older equipment/poor video quality, making them suitable for a more relaxed threshold.
  - `Classroom Location Rules`: "Zongjiao/Lijiao/Yanlou" → Relaxed; Others → Normal.
  - `Strict` mode has extremely high detection sensitivity.
  - `Standard` mode is relatively balanced, effectively detecting small text additions/deletions.

<table align="center" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="33%">
      <img src="docs/a.png" alt="Fig 1" />
      <br>
      <strong>Relaxed Mode</strong>
    </td>
    <td align="center" width="33%">
      <img src="docs/b.png" alt="Fig 2" />
      <br>
      <strong>Strict Mode</strong>
    </td>
    <td align="center" width="33%">
      <img src="docs/c.png" alt="Fig 3" />
      <br>
      <strong>Standard Mode</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

2. `Slide Stability Check` is based on the assumption that a speaker usually stays on the same slide for a while to explain. Checking if a new slide remains unchanged for several consecutive checks excludes animations, videos, and slight movements.
  - With `Slide Stability Check` enabled, `Check Count` set to `2`, and `Slide Detection Interval` set to `2000` ms, a slide is saved only if it "stably" displays for at least `6` seconds.
  - `Slide Detection Interval` is the interval at 1x speed. Actual interval adjusts with playback speed; at high speeds, `JavaScript` execution is slowed, with a minimum actual interval of `200` ms.

> [!TIP]
> If the speaker flips slides quickly, some slides shown for too short a time won't be saved if `Slide Stability Check` is enabled.
>
> This is reasonable because if you can't write it down in class, you probably can't save it. If you believe the skipped slides are important, you can manually pause during playback to capture them.

3. Image compression uses `PNG Color Compression`.
  - Normal PNGs use "True Color" mode, where each pixel's color is directly defined by red, green, blue, and alpha channels. This mode can show millions of colors but results in large file sizes.
  - `Compress PNG Image Palette Size` quantizes colors to 128 or fewer significantly reducing file size.
  - For slides with limited colors, compression is effective with little visual loss, keeping text sharp.

## 🛠 Architecture

### SSIM-based Slide Detection

AutoSlides uses a modified Global Structure Similarity Index (G-SSIM) for image comparison to detect slide changes, confirmed through a dual verification mechanism. Full technical details can be found in [`report.pdf`](report.pdf).

```typescript
// Core SSIM Calculation (Simplified)
function calculateSSIM(img1: ImageData, img2: ImageData): number {
  const gray1 = convertToGrayscale(img1);
  const gray2 = convertToGrayscale(img2);

  // Calculate means, variances and covariance
  const [mean1, mean2] = calculateMeans(gray1, gray2);
  const [var1, var2, covar] = calculateVariances(gray1, gray2, mean1, mean2);

  // SSIM formula constants
  const C1 = 0.01 * 255 * 0.01 * 255;
  const C2 = 0.03 * 255 * 0.03 * 255;

  const numerator = (2 * mean1 * mean2 + C1) * (2 * covar + C2);
  const denominator = (mean1 * mean1 + mean2 * mean2 + C1) * (var1 + var2 + C2);

  return numerator / denominator;
}
```
